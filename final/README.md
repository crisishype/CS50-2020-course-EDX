My final project was a homage to old school video games. I made a Snake clone in Lua for LOve2d.
The project was fairly tricky but I got everything to work after research, and trial error.
Overall the project took about 2 months, and I'm happy with the completion.  There is more I could have
added but it's like that for all video games.  It has a custom snake font, music, sound effects for collisions,
grabbing apples, and for the ending. The snake wraps around the screen as well and moves in a continuous motion.
There is also a level system that escalates after the required apples is met.
You only get 3 lives, and you lose a life if you collide with your tail, or run into an obstacle.  Also dying resets
you from the starting location with no tail.  The obstacles increase in numbers as the levels get harder as well.
The arrow keys move the snake, and the enter, space bar, and escape keys are implemented as well. Also there is a title
on the top of the window.  I hope you enjoy my project, and keep a lookout for many more to come! Thank You
